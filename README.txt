Opened visual studio and Started by creating a new ASP.NET core MVC project named Illumination with authentication.
Ran the initial project to see if it was working properly.
Created Controller named HelloWorldController 
Made a folder name HelloWorld to create a razor view called index.cshtml
Created a data model class called lamp.cs to input the attributes of the lamp.

Adding nuget packages to use scaffolding tools to produce CRUD pages for the lamp model.
Ran the app and got SQLexception error
Forgot to update the database so this error was created
Solution:Used migration to create and updated the database
Examined the generated database context class and the initial create class to make sure it was all good.
